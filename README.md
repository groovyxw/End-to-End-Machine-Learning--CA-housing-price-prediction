# CA-housing-price-prediction

## Problem
In Silicon Valley, housing market is always hot. If we can predict a districtâ€™s median housing price, then we can feed them to another Machine Learning system along with many other signals to determine whether this district is worth investing in a given area or not.


## Solution

This project fits supervised Learning & regression task to predict a value among three basic ML algorithms.
It also fits batch learning since the data is plain to fit in memory.
Finally, we can use RMSE to measure the performance.
