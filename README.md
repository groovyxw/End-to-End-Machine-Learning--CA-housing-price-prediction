## Problem
In Silicon Valley, housing market is always hot. If we can predict a districtâ€™s median housing price, then we can feed them to another Machine Learning system along with many other signals to determine whether this district is worth investing in a given area or not.

## Solution

This project fits supervised Learning & regression task to predict a value among three basic ML algorithms.

It also fits batch learning since the data is plain to fit in memory.

We will compare linear regression with decision tree model and find the better one.

Finally, we can use RMSE to measure the performance.
